    "body": "<p>\r\nOur industry needs to help educate its own future.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn the last couple of years there's been a growing movement in open source to reach out to and help computer science teachers in our public schools.  And here\u2019s one of the reasons why: the tech industry is growing quickly - even now, there simply aren't enough qualified bodies to fill all the jobs, and the best way to prepare for the future is to focus on educating kids now.  \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAs citizens, we can advocate for computer science requirements in public schools, and to help it get the funding that it needs.   But as programmers, we should be able to do something more.  As open source developers, we already understand that there's a payoff when we donate our time and talents.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nSo here's what I'm proposing: a program that brings programming professionals together with local computer science educators, for classroom visits and mentoring.   Here\u2019s how it works: you sign up, you get paired with a teacher, and you make plans for your classroom visit.   What I'm talking about is building a roster of developers who are willing to visit computer science classrooms, to go in and talk to students in middle school and high school, to give them a real description of what our careers are like and what kinds of things we had to learn to get there.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIf you're in Austin and you're interested in getting in on this, sign up here.\r\n</p>",

    "body": "<p>\r\nA little over a month ago now, just as the new school year was about to begin, I had the privilege of attending a meeting of the local chapter of <a href=\"http://csta.acm.org/\">Computer Science Teachers Association</a> here in Austin.  I didn't really have any plans - my goal was just to get to know some of these local teachers and see if there was a way that I could help.  Help how?  I had no idea.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBut as we got to talking, it became clear that what would be most welcome - at least for now - would be to get developers into the classrooms, to have them talk to students about their careers and maybe get involved directly, through mentoring and teaching.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAnd so the gears in my head started turning.  \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nLast year, I volunteered with a local program called <a href=\"http://www.centexeweek.org/\">Central Texas Discover Engineering</a>.  It's a terrific way to reach out to schools and promote STEM: Through CTDE, science professionals can sign up, get paired with an elementary school teacher/classroom, and make plans for a school visit. This past spring, a few of us from PyLadies went to visit a 5th grade class in south Austin to give a talk about how we use programming in our jobs. The kids were so curious and enthusiastic - imagine how receptive a classroom of aspiring programmers would have been?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nCTDE has more of a general science focus, but I wanted to adopt their model, so instead I'm working on building a roster of developers that are available specifically for visiting with Computer Science students in middle and high schools.  The way I'm envisioning it, these classroom visits could just mean talking to students about what software development careers are like and what kinds of things you need to learn to get there. They might also involve some teaching, one-on-one mentoring, or extras such as helping to run an after-school computer club, if we find developer volunteers who are interested in doing those things.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAnd now I'm in a little bit over my head, but loving every minute of it.  This is the first time I've ever attempted to put together a program like this.  So far, we've gotten a huge response from the handful of user groups we've reached out to.  Austin's developer community gets it - they're lining up to get into the classrooms and help kids.  It's been a little slower getting the word out to teachers, but that is starting to take off as well.  My hope is that signups on both sides will continue, so that Austin developers are continuing to work with area educators throughout the school year.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAs teachers and developers have signed on, I've generated welcome emails, but the first letters matching volunteers to school just went out today.  Volunteers are being asked to contact the teachers, but both sides are getting information about each other: teachers learn about the specialties and expertise of the volunteers they've been matched with, and volunteers get a little information about the classes they expect to be visiting - how big the classes are, what age group, what languages they're working with.  It's up to the teacher and volunteer to negotiate what the content of the classroom visit will be.  We're suggesting things like career talks, coding demonstrations, and mentoring, but these visits are really open to whatever the teacher and developer agree on.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn the meantime, I'm hoping to focus on getting a web site together - right now, this whole project consists of a couple of Google Drive forms and a spreadsheet.  Oh, and a couple of scripts to generate the emails.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nMy plan is to harness the brain power of our local PyLadies chapter and put together a team to help with a web site.  We just need a handful of features - separate signups for teachers and developers, a page of presentation ideas and activity resources that developers can use when planning their visits, some automation for the teacher/volunteer matching, and automation for the assortment of emails that have to be sent.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThere is one thing holding us back - the project does not have a name.  So if you know how to reach me and you have an idea, please let me know.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI'm really looking forward to seeing what an impact this program makes on local computer science classrooms this year.  We're keeping it simple for 2013-2014, but if it's a success, we might expand and do some different things for the next school year.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nOnce the first classroom visits begin, I'll update on how well it's all working out.  \r\n</p>",
