As citizens, we can help you by advocating for computer science requirements in public schools, and for the funding that you need.  But as programmers, we can do something more.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI'm currently building a roster of developers who are enthusiastic about visiting your computer science classrooms.  These programmers come from communities across the Austin tech world, working in different languages and fields.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe list is growing, so what I need next are the computer science classrooms who are looking for programmers to visit.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe goal is to pair each developer with an interested educator and let you decide between yourselves what's involved in the classroom visit - having programmers talk to students about their own careers, do a little teaching, or help promote computer science in some other way.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nSo if you're teaching computer science in the Austin area and you're interested in getting in on this, sign up here.\r\n</p>",

    "body": "<p>Our industry needs to help educate its own future.</p>\r\n<p>In the last couple of years there's been a growing movement in open source to reach out to and help computer science teachers in our public schools.  And here\u2019s one of the reasons why: the tech industry is growing quickly - even now, there simply aren't enough qualified bodies to fill all the jobs, and the best way to prepare for the future is to focus on educating kids now.</p>\r\n<p>As citizens, we can advocate for computer science requirements in public schools, and to help it get the funding that it needs.   But as programmers, we should be able to do something more.  As open source developers, we already understand that there's a payoff when we donate our time and talents.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nSo here's what I'm proposing: a program that brings programming professionals together with local computer science educators, for classroom visits and mentoring.   Here\u2019s how it works: you sign up, you get paired with a teacher, and you make plans for your classroom visit.   What I'm talking about is building a roster of developers who are willing to visit computer science classrooms, to go in and talk to students in middle school and high school, to give them a real description of what our careers are like and what kinds of things we had to learn to get there.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIf you're in Austin and you're interested in getting in on this, sign up here.\r\n</p>",

    "body": "<p>Welcome!  This project came about from a desire to build relationships between members of the local programming community and computer science educators through the local chapter of the <a href=\"http://csta.acm.org/\">Computer Science Teachers Association</a> here in Austin.</p>\r\n<p>What we're trying to do: get developers into the classrooms, to have them talk to students about their careers and maybe get involved directly, through mentoring and teaching.</p>\r\n<p>How it works: programming professionals and computer science educators can sign up, get paired and make plans for a school visit.  These classroom visits can include:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>a Q&A with students about what software development careers are like and what kinds of things they needed to learn</li>\r\n<li>live demonstrations of coding work</li>\r\n<li>one-on-one mentoring, or extras such as helping to plan an after-school computer club</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>All of that is up to the teacher and developer, who are free to negotiate whatever they'd like to see presented to students.</p>\r\n<p>What you'll find on this site: Separate signups for teachers and developers, plus (coming) a page of presentation ideas and activity resources that developers can use when planning their visits.</p>\r\n<p>Thanks for taking an interest in computer science classrooms!  I'm looking forward to seeing what an impact this program makes on Austin area students this year!</p>",
