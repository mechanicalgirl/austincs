Thanks for volunteering to visit a computer science classroom in Austin!

Classroom matches are happening now, so watch your email for more information.  Once paired with a CS teacher, below are the follow-up steps to make your visit a success:


Step 1: Contact your assigned teacher

You'll get contact information - a phone number or email address - for a computer science teacher in the Austin area.  Coordinate with that teacher to set a date and time, then work together to confirm the details of your visit.
 
Step 2: Plan your visit

Your classroom visit can include almost anything.  You'll be going in and talking to computer science students in middle and high schools, so maybe you'll want to chat with them and answer questions about what software development careers are like and what kinds of things you need to learn to get there.  Students might also be interested in seeing demonstrations of your coding work.  You may even be able to get involved in some teaching, one-on-one mentoring, or extras such as helping to run an after-school computer club if you're interested.

All of that is up to you and the teacher you're paired with - talk about what you'd like to present to the students, and if you need help planning, feel free to contact me at barbara.shaurette@gmail.com.

Step 3: Enjoy!
 
If you have any trouble connecting with your teacher or find that you aren't able to coordinate a visit, please contact me at barbara.shaurette@gmail.com.
 

Thanks for helping Austin area students learn more about computer science!
