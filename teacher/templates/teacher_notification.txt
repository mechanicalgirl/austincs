Thanks for signing up as part of an outreach program to get developers from the Austin programming community into your classrooms.

Classroom matches have already begun, so watch your email for more information.  Soon you'll be paired with a developer in the Austin area who's looking forward to working with you to bring information about computer science careers to your students.

Among the topics that this developer might be able to present:
- a Q&A with students about what software development careers are like and what kinds of things they needed to learn
- live demonstrations of coding work
- one-on-one mentoring, or extras such as helping to plan an after-school computer club

All of that is up to you and the developer - feel free to negotiate on what you'd like to see presented to your students.

Thanks for opening your classroom to a volunteer!  I'm looking forward to seeing what an impact this program makes on your students this year!
